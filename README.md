# Digits-Recognition

This repository contains a Python implementation of digit recognition using Tensorflow and Keras. The project utilizes a neural network for image classification.

## Library used
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Numpy
* Matplotlib

##Data
The dataset used for this project is the famous MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9). The data is already included in the repository, so there is no need to download it separately.

##Model
The project uses a simple feedforward neural network with a few hidden layers for classification. The model is trained using the MNIST data and achieves an accuracy of around 98% on the test set.

##Output
The script will display the predictions for some sample images, along with the actual labels. The model's accuracy on the test set will also be displayed.
